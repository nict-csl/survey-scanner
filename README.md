# survey-scanner
This repository publishes the sources of Internet-Wide Scans.

The list was created from [NICTER darknet monitoring](https://www.nicter.jp/en). We have examined source IP addresses of the packets observed at NICTER and identified the survey-scan organization and their IP addresses by reverse DNS lookups, WHOIS searches, and HTTP(S) accesses to the scannerâ€™s IP addresses. We also searched for relevant descriptions on the official website of each survey-scanner. The detailed process can be found at [NICTER report 2023](https://csl.nict.go.jp/report/NICTER_report_2023.pdf).

## scanorg
In each period, we identify survey-scan organizations. The scanorg csv file contains the list of name, type, TCP port counts, UDP port counts, observed days in the period and a reference URL of each survey-scan organization. The list is sorted in descending order of the number of packets observed in the period.

(e.g.)
```
scanorg_2023.csv
```

## survey-scanners' IP addresses
In each period, we identify IP addresses of survey-scanners. The JSON file contains the list of IP address, name of the survey-scan organization and the last date when we observed a scan packet from the IP address in the period.

(e.g.)
```
surveyscanner_2023.json
```

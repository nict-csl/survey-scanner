# survey-scanner
This repository publishes the sources of Internet-Wide Scans. 

The list was created from [NICTER darknet monitoring](https://www.nicter.jp/en). We have examined source IP addresses of the packets observed at NICTER and identified the survey-scan organization and their IP addresses by reverse DNS lookups, WHOIS searches, and HTTP(S) accesses to the scannerâ€™s IP addresses. We also searched for relevant descriptions on the official website of each survey-scanner. The detailed process can be found at [NICTER report 2023](https://csl.nict.go.jp/report/NICTER_report_2023.pdf).
